        "In this practice project, you will learn to classify images of fruits into different categories using transfer learning. The pre-trained VGG16 model will be used as the base, and custom layers will be added to fine-tune the model for our specific task. This approach allows us to leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset (ImageNet) and apply it to a smaller, custom dataset with minimal computational resources and data.\n",

The local waste management organization, EcoClean, is tasked with improving the efficiency of waste sorting. However, the current manual process is both time-consuming and error-prone. To enhance the system, EcoClean wants you to develop an AI-powered solution that can automatically classify waste products using image recognition techniques. This project aims to build a model that can differentiate between recyclable and organic waste products using transfer learning.\n",

The manual sorting of waste is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, leading to contamination of recyclable materials. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision to automate the classification of waste products, improving efficiency and reducing contamination rates. The project will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images.\n",
