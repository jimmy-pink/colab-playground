    "# Practice Project Overview: Fruit Classification Using Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practice project, you will learn to classify images of fruits into different categories using transfer learning. The pre-trained VGG16 model will be used as the base, and custom layers will be added to fine-tune the model for our specific task. This approach allows us to leverage the knowledge learned from a large dataset (ImageNet) and apply it to a smaller, custom dataset with minimal computational resources and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to classify images of different fruits using a machine learning model. You will train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize various fruit categories using the power of transfer learning with a pre-trained model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning enables leveraging pre-trained models for custom tasks with limited data.\n",
